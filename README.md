# What is Solr?
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

# How to use this Docker image

To run a single Solr server:

    SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -p 8983:8983 -t marvinb8/search-api-solr)

Then with a web browser go to `http://localhost:8983/` to see the Admin Console (adjust the hostname for your docker host).

In the web UI if you click on "Core Admin" you should now see the "myindex" core.

To learn more about Solr, see the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Apache+Solr+Reference+Guide).
